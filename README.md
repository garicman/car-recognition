# Car Recognition — Archived Notebook

This repository preserves an older machine-learning project for **car brand recognition**.
It contains the original Jupyter notebook and minimal scaffolding so it’s easy to run and archive.

- **Main file:** `notebooks/2_brands.ipynb`
- **Status:** Archived / read-only
- **Owner:** Martin Garic

## Dataset layou

- `2brands/` — two subfolders, each corresponding to **one car brand** (binary classification).
- `3brands/` — three subfolders: two specific brands **plus** a folder with **random brands** (treated as an **'other'** class).

These folders are classic *ImageFolder* style (one directory per class).

## Notes
- This repo keeps the **original notebook** for posterity; it may not reflect current best practices.
- Data is included.
